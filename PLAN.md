### Backend Implementation
- [x] **Public API Endpoint** (`/scheduler/api/public/schedule/`)
  - Created `public_schedule_data` view that returns active season data

  - Losers shown in lighter gray (#666) vs winners in dark (#333)
  - Maintains clean aesthetic without jarring colors

- [x] **Enhanced Filtering System**
  - Replaced toggle buttons with clean multiselect dropdowns
  - Four filter types: Levels, Courts, Referees, Teams
  - Multiselect capability with "All" option handling
  - Combined filtering (all filters work together)
  - Hide past games toggle button with smart date/time detection
  - Stable week numbering unaffected by filtering

### Data Integration
