# USBF League Schedule Generator

## Overview

This project is a basketball league schedule generator designed to create balanced schedules for multi-level leagues. It uses advanced algorithms to generate schedules that satisfy various constraints and balance requirements. The application has evolved into a full-featured web application with a React frontend and Django backend.

## Key Features

- **Multi-Level Support**: Handles leagues with multiple divisions/levels (A, B, C)
- **Round-Robin Scheduling**: Ensures each team plays against every other team in their level
- **Referee Assignments**: Automatically assigns referees for each game
- **Balanced Scheduling**:
  - Controls how many times teams play in each time slot
  - Ensures fair referee assignments
  - Maintains balanced court usage across time slots
- **Constraint Satisfaction**:
  - Teams don't play and referee simultaneously
  - Referees are scheduled in adjacent time slots to their games
  - Configurable limits on how many times teams play in specific slots
- **Optimization**: Uses simulated annealing to improve schedule balance
- **Mirrored Scheduling**: Creates schedules where the second half mirrors the first half's matchups
- **Validation**: Comprehensive validation of generated schedules
- **Modern Web Interface**: React-based Single Page Application for schedule management
- **Season Management**: Create and manage multiple seasons with different team rosters
- **Score Tracking**: Record and view game scores throughout the season

## Architecture

### Backend

- **Django**: Provides the web framework, models, views, and API endpoints
- **Python Schedule Generator**: Core algorithm for creating balanced schedules
- **RESTful API**: JSON endpoints for communication with the frontend

### Frontend

- **React**: Single Page Application for responsive UI
- **React Router**: Client-side routing for seamless navigation
- **Context API**: Global state management with reducers
- **Webpack**: Asset bundling and optimization

## Project Structure

- `/scheduler/`: Django app containing models, views, and templates
- `/assets/js/schedule-app/`: React application
  - `/components/`: Reusable UI components
  - `/pages/`: Page-level components mapped to routes
  - `/contexts/`: React Context providers
  - `/hooks/`: Custom React hooks
  - `/styles/`: CSS files
- `/schedule.py`: Core schedule generation algorithm

## Schedule Configuration

The schedule generator is highly configurable through the `config` dictionary: 
```python
config = {
    # League structure
    "total_weeks": 10,
    "levels": ["A", "B", "C"], # Names of the levels/divisions
    "teams_per_level": { # Number of teams in each level
        "A": 6,
        "B": 6,
        "C": 6,
    },
    # Schedule structure
    "courts_per_slot": {
        1: 2,
        2: 2,
        3: 2,
        4: 3,
    }, # Number of courts available in each slot (1-indexed)
}
```

## Schedule Generation Algorithm

The schedule generation uses a **two-phase optimization approach**:

### Phase 1: Matchup Generation
- Creates multiple unique round-robin matchup blueprints
- Ensures each team plays every other team in their level equally
- Generates different valid matchup combinations to explore

### Phase 2: Slot & Referee Optimization  
- Takes each matchup blueprint and optimizes slot/referee assignments
- Uses **soft constraints** with penalty-based objective function
- Automatically balances without requiring manual limits

## Automatic Balancing System

The algorithm uses **weighted soft constraints** instead of hard limits:

### **Slot Distribution Balancing**
- **Target-based**: Calculates expected games per slot based on court availability
- **Weighted penalties**: 15x higher weight for first/last slots vs middle slots
- **Automatic fairness**: No team consistently stuck with early/late times

### **Referee Balancing** 
- **Soft hard limits**: Teams should referee target Â±1 games (1000pt penalty for violations)
- **Adjacent-slot rule**: Referees must play in adjacent time slots (prevents conflicts)
- **Level-based**: Only teams from same level can referee each other

### **First/Last Slot Protection**
- **Special constraints**: 500pt penalties for teams getting too many first/last slot games
- **Fair distribution**: Ensures inconvenient times are shared equally

### **No Manual Configuration Required**
- Algorithm automatically determines optimal balance based on league structure
- Penalty-based system finds best possible solution within constraints

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/platelminto/basketball-scheduler.git
   cd usbf-schedule
   ```

2. Create a virtual environment and install dependencies:
   ```bash
   # Option 1: Using traditional venv
   python -m venv .venv
   source .venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   npm install

   
   # Option 2: Using uv (recommended)
   uv sync
   npm install
   ```

3. Set up the database:
   ```bash
   python manage.py migrate
   ```

4. Create a superuser:
   ```bash
   python manage.py createsuperuser
   ```

5. Build frontend assets:
   ```bash
   npm run build
   ```

## Development Workflow

1. Run the Django development server:
   ```bash
   python manage.py runserver
   ```

2. Watch frontend assets for development:
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

## Usage

### Web Interface

1. Access the application at `http://localhost:8000/scheduler/app/`
2. Create a new season and set up teams
3. Generate a schedule or manually create games
4. Edit the schedule as needed
5. Record scores as games are played

### Programmatic Usage

```python
from schedule import find_schedule
# Generate a new schedule
final_schedule, total_attempts = find_schedule(use_saved_schedule=False)

# Print the schedule
from utils import print_schedule
print_schedule(final_schedule)

# Save the schedule to a file
from utils import save_schedule_to_file
save_schedule_to_file(final_schedule, "my_schedule.json")
```

## API Endpoints
